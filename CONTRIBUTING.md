# Contribution Guidelines

This document outlines the guidelines for contributing to FunnyOS 2 or any  
associated programs/plugins.

## Please Use camelCase and Tables

Variables in FunnyOS 2 are usually declared using camelCase in which the first  
character is lowercase, no underscores are used, and subsequent words are capitalised.  
  
I'm sure some variables in the program currently do not follow this standard,  
but please do not try to fix them as you will probably screw something up.  

## Use configVars for Aesthetics



## Provide meaningful commit messages

It is preferred that you list everything that a commit does in detail so that I  
know where to make sure everything works. I will not be following this guidelione  
because I already know what my commits do.
